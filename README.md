*NOTE*: _This is just a tentative template for your team to start working on sprint 0. It is a minimum requirement for your project final report and can be updated later.
Your team can revise/add more sections, however, it is highly recommended to seek approval from the instructor for a pull request._

# Overview

The goal of this project is to determine a method to compress a learning structure, such as a deep neural network or fuzy network, into a minimum network required to satisfy the objective.

# Project Context and Scope

This project is a contribution to research into the development of machine learning models that learn intuitively.

# System Analysis

## High-level Requirements

List high-level requirements of the project that your team will develop into use cases in later steps

## Use cases

Draw the overview use case diagram, and define use case description _(Main focus of Sprint 0)_

# System Design

## Use-Case Realization

## Database 

## User Interface


# Implementation

## Deployment

# Software Process Management

## Scrum process

### Sprint 0

Duration: 20/01/2021-27/01/2021

#### Completed Tasks: 

1. Studied fuzzy inference systems from material provided from Galois
2. Studied automatic differentiation.

#### Sprint Retrospection:

| Good     |   Could have been better    |  How to improve?  |
|----------|:---------------------------:|------------------:|
| learned a lot of preliminary information | documentation of progress | take more notes on what I read about/discover |
