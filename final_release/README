This directory contains the Jupyter Notebook workspace that was used and the _current state_ of the research paper. The paper is not finished yet, but it is getting there. Most of the experiments that I plan on including have been performed and are included in the paper. I still plan on using the learned equations to actually perform the image-classification task to see if its accuracy compares with the neural network. I might also include something about CNNs, but that's not certain.
